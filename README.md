# ‚≠ê Diabetes Risk Predictor

**Overview**  
This project develops a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes using health metrics like glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, and age. It includes an interactive web app and model interpretability tools for transparency.


## Why This Project?
Diabetes affects millions globally. Early risk prediction can empower preventive action. This project not only demonstrates ML model performance but also emphasizes interpretability using tools like SHAP.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
